Responsible for the following components:
  1. **[Population Genetic Analysis of _Pomacea spp._ in Subtropical Regions](https://ziweiwuzw.github.io/Personal-Homepage/files/1.Population_Genetic.pdf).**
  &emsp; Early extraction of DNA from 16 individuals of the apple snail species _Pomacea canaliculata_, followed by the construction of second-generation genomic libraries (using the TN5 transposase method) for population genetics analysis of the apple snail population.
  2. **[Research on the Adaptability of Apple Snails: Transcriptomic Analysis in Low-Temperature Environments](https://ziweiwuzw.github.io/Personal-Homepage/files/2.Transcriptomic_Analysis.pdf).**
   &emsp; Sequencing of the microbial community within termite nest environments (second and third-generation sequencing). Utilizing second-generation (as described above) and third-generation (ONT) sequencing technologies to construct environmental microbial community libraries and sequence them, revealing microbial diversity and potential functions within termite nests.
  4. **[Metagenomic Study of the Black-winged Subterranean Termite (_Odontotermes formosanus_) and its Ecological Function in Lignocellulose Degradation](https://ziweiwuzw.github.io/Personal-Homepage/files/3.Metagenomic_Study.pdf).**
   &emsp; Utilizing second and third-generation sequencing technologies, constructing and sequencing libraries from termite nest microbiota, uncovering microbial diversity and functionalities.
  5. **Bioinformatics component (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
   &emsp; Primarily responsible for instructing RNA-seq data processing and analysis while also providing assistance in guiding data analysis for ATAC-seq and Metagenomic studies.
