Responsible for the following components:
  1. **[Population Genetic Analysis of _Pomacea spp._ in Subtropical Regions](https://ziweiwuzw.github.io/Personal-Homepage/files/1.Population_Genetic.pdf).**
     * &emsp; Extraction of DNA from 16 individuals of the apple snail species _Pomacea canaliculata_, followed by the construction of second-generation genomic libraries (using the TN5 transposase method) for population genetics analysis of the apple snail population.
  2. **[Research on the Adaptability of Apple Snails: Transcriptomic Analysis in Low-Temperature Environments](https://ziweiwuzw.github.io/Personal-Homepage/files/2.Transcriptomic_Analysis.pdf).**
     * &emsp; Collected samples of apple snails, dividing them into a control group (6 individuals) and a low-temperature experimental group (3 individuals). The control group was kept at a constant 25 degrees Celsius for 6 days. The low-temperature group experienced a 3-day exposure at 25 degrees Celsius followed by a gradual decrease to 5 degrees Celsius for another 3 days. We extracted RNA from the muscle tissue of individuals in both groups, initially using the Trizol method, and then converted it to cDNA using SMART-seq2. Subsequently, a second-generation genome library was constructed (utilizing the Tn5 technique) to explore further the adaptive mechanisms of apple snails under low-temperature stress conditions.
  3. **[Metagenomic Study of the Subterranean Termite (_Odontotermes formosanus_) and its Ecological Function in Lignocellulose Degradation](https://ziweiwuzw.github.io/Personal-Homepage/files/3.Metagenomic_Study.pdf).**
     * &emsp; Sequencing of the microbial community within termite nest environments (second and third-generation sequencing). Utilizing second-generation (as described above) and third-generation (ONT) sequencing technologies to construct environmental microbial community libraries and sequence them, revealing microbial diversity and potential functions within termite nests.
  4. **Bioinformatics component (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
     * &emsp; Primarily responsible for instructing RNA-seq data processing and analysis while also providing assistance in guiding data analysis for ATAC-seq and Metagenomic studies.
