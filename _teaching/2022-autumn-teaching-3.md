Responsible for the high-throughput sequencing module, it is divided into the following components:
* **1. Re-sequencing Library Construction of Freshwater Snail Genome (Utilizing TN5 Transposase Method):**
* &emsp; Building re-sequencing libraries of the freshwater snail genome using the TN5 transposase technique to gather genomic DNA sequence information, providing vital support for genomic research.
* **2. Freshwater Snail ATAC-seq Library Construction:**
* &emsp; Constructing libraries from freshwater snail samples using ATAC-seq technology, analyzing open chromatin regions to explore gene expression regulatory mechanisms.
* **3. RNA Library Construction of Freshwater Snail Muscles under Low-Temperature Stress:**
* &emsp; Constructing RNA sequencing libraries from freshwater snail muscle samples subjected to low-temperature stress, delving into gene expression and transcriptional changes, revealing molecular responses in diverse environments.
* **4. Microbial Library Sequencing of Termite Nest Microbiota (Second and Third Generation Sequencing):**
* &emsp; Utilizing second and third-generation sequencing technologies, constructing and sequencing libraries from termite nest microbiota, uncovering microbial diversity and functionalities.
* **5. Bioinformatics Segment â€” Data Processing (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
* &emsp; Responsible for processing and analyzing ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and metagenomic data, extracting information regarding genomes, transcriptomes, and microbial communities from sequencing data, providing crucial support for research outcomes.
