Responsible for the following components:
* **1. Re-sequencing Library Construction of Apple Snail Genome (Utilizing TN5 Transposase Method):**
* &emsp; Early extraction of DNA from 16 individuals of the apple snail species _Pomacea canaliculata_, followed by the construction of second-generation genomic libraries (using the TN5 transposase method) for population genetics analysis of the apple snail population.
* **2. RNA Library Construction of Freshwater Snail Muscles under Low-Temperature Stress:**
* &emsp; Sequencing of the microbial community within termite nest environments (second and third-generation sequencing). Utilizing second-generation (as described above) and third-generation (ONT) sequencing technologies to construct environmental microbial community libraries and sequence them, revealing microbial diversity and potential functions within termite nests.
* **3. Microbial Library Sequencing of Termite Nest Microbiota (Second and Third Generation Sequencing):**
* &emsp; Utilizing second and third-generation sequencing technologies, constructing and sequencing libraries from termite nest microbiota, uncovering microbial diversity and functionalities.
* **4. Bioinformatics Segment â€” Data Processing (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
* &emsp; Primarily responsible for instructing RNA-seq data processing and analysis while also providing assistance in guiding data analysis for ATAC-seq and Metagenomic studies.
