Responsible for the high-throughput sequencing module, the course encompasses the following components:

**1. Genomic Second-generation Library Construction (utilizing TN5 transposase method):**
Constructing genomic second-generation sequencing libraries using the TN5 transposase technique to acquire genomic DNA sequence information, providing a foundational dataset for genomic research.

**2. Gill ATAC-seq Library Construction:**
Employing ATAC-seq technology to build libraries from gill samples, investigating open chromatin regions and unveiling gene expression regulatory mechanisms.

**3. Gill TRACE-Seq RNA seq Library Construction:**
Employing TRACE-Seq technology to craft RNA sequencing libraries from gill samples, conducting in-depth analyses of gene expression and transcriptional changes, thereby probing molecular responses under different conditions.

**4. Environmental Microbial Second and Third-generation Library Sequencing:**
Applying second and third-generation sequencing technologies to construct and sequence libraries from environmental microbial communities, uncovering microbial diversity and potential functions.

**5. Bioinformatics Sectionâ€”Data Processing (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
Responsible for the processing and analysis of ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and metagenomic data, extracting information pertinent to genomes, transcriptomes, and microbial communities from sequencing data to underpin research findings.
