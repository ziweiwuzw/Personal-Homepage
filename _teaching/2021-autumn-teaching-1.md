I am primarily responsible for _preparing experimental reagents, conducting preliminary experiments, and guiding students_. The course encompasses the following components:
  1. **Construction of second-generation genomic libraries using DNA from crucian carp (utilizing TN5 transposase method).**
  2. **Crucian carp gill ATAC-seq Library Construction:**
     &emsp; Employing ATAC-seq technology to construct second-generation DNA libraries, investigating open chromatin regions, and unraveling gene expression regulation mechanisms.
  4. **Construction of gill TRACE-Seq RNA-seq libraries:**
     &emsp; Utilizing TRACE-Seq to convert RNA from fish gills into cDNA and constructing cDNA libraries using the TN5 transposase method.
  5. **Environmental Microbial Second and Third-generation Library Sequencing:**
     &emsp; Applying second-generation (Tn5) and third-generation (ONT) sequencing technologies to construct environmental microbial community libraries and sequence them, revealing microbial diversity and potential functions.
  6. **Bioinformatics component(ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
     &emsp; Responsible for instructing RNA-seq data processing and analysis.
