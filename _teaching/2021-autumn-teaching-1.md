Responsible for the high-throughput sequencing module, the course encompasses the following components:
* **1. Construction of second-generation genomic libraries using DNA from crucian carp (utilizing TN5 transposase method).**
* &emsp; 
* **2. Crucian carp gill ATAC-seq Library Construction:**
* &emsp; Employing ATAC-seq technology to construct second-generation DNA libraries, investigating open chromatin regions, and unraveling gene expression regulation mechanisms.
* **3. Construction of gill TRACE-Seq RNA-seq libraries:**
* &emsp; Utilizing TRACE-Seq to convert RNA from fish gills into cDNA and constructing cDNA libraries using the TN5 transposase method.
* **4. Environmental Microbial Second and Third-generation Library Sequencing:**
* &emsp; Applying second-generation (Tn5) and third-generation (ONT) sequencing technologies to construct environmental microbial community libraries and sequence them, revealing microbial diversity and potential functions.
* **5. Bioinformatics Section—Data Processing (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Metagenomic Analysis):**
* &emsp; Responsible for instructing RNA-seq data processing and analysis.
