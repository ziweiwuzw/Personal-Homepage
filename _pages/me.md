## Facing Challenges
Fortunately, I encountered interpersonal failures at an early age, between 19 and 21. Those three years taught me how to face the scrutiny of others, whether it's well-intentioned or not, and how to stay true to myself. During that time, I gained insights into many profound truths – in other words, I indulged in a lot of self-improvement and motivational content (some might call it "chicken soup for the soul"). To divert my attention, I invested most of my time in self-enhancement and honing my research skills. I grew to understand and embrace all facets of myself (which is incredibly important). After another three years, I completely transcended my past failures. I made new friends, became more open to diverse people, experiences, and ways of life. I learned to live in the present and savor each day. Now, it feels as if I've risen from the ashes like a phoenix, ready to embrace the world.

## Matters of the Heart
I'm really thankful for crossing paths with that special someone during my prime years. Being loved and returning the favour are equally important. Thankfully, I've learned the art of treasuring it all. Sure, there might be a few "what ifs," but it's pretty common for couples to look back with a touch of nostalgia when life's circumstances (and maybe a few personal quirks) push them in different directions.

## Living the Good Life
Embrace each day – that's my motto. I believe a beautiful day starts with breakfast. I enjoy cooking – perhaps it's a significant factor in maintaining my good mental state. Cooking always brings joy (maybe due to a sense of achievement), haha. I believe someone who can conduct successful experiments can't be too bad at cooking. In my view, cooking is like conducting an experiment – following the instructions step by step, and success is likely.

## Decision Time
I never regret the decisions I make. First, because I am the one making those decisions, I accept all consequences. Second, I carefully consider the logic, thoughts, and potential outcomes behind every decision I make. Once I've thought through these aspects, I make my decision. So please don't fault me for taking a long time to ponder. Convincing myself also is a form of mental massage.

## Learning the Ropes
I'm not a genius, and I don't have an eidetic memory or some crazy intellect. So, how do I learn? Simple – I read a lot and write a lot. The magic of "getting it" lies in the accumulation. When you accumulate enough, sudden understanding emerges, and doors to new worlds swing open. Then, on the foundation of "massive accumulation," there's a burst of progress, leaving others behind. Everything begins with simplicity, enduring the initial challenges and gradually achieving enlightenment. Think about it like taking baby steps. Similar to how little kids start taking those wobbly first steps. Even the most incredible long-distance runners had to start somewhere. Or perhaps intelligence arises from countless connections, unexpectedly springing forth. Thus, "quantity" becomes the key. You have to keep inputting, waiting for your brain to naturally "emerge."

## Passions and Pleasures
I enjoy reading. Spending time exploring the realms of others' minds is an incredible feeling. It's like travelling the world without leaving home. Whether it's fantasy or reality, fiction or biography, novels with boundless imagination tend to be the most interesting. Reading biographies of notable figures is akin to recharging me, rapidly restoring my energy.
