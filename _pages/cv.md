RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
======
*  1. **Multi-omics study on the lignocellulose degradation by holobionts in mangrove sesarmid crabs: a game-changer for terrestrialization**
* Nov. 2022 - Present
* **Co-first author**, in progress, in collaboration with The Chinese University of Hong Kong	
* 	Led the assembly of three Sesarmidae genomes.
* 	Conducted gene functional annotations, focusing on CAZymes, using public databases. 
* 	Analyzed genomic collinearity, evaluated CAZymes families, and identified unique gene families and expansions/contractions. 
* 	Combined metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to uncover crab lignocellulose degradation mechanisms and evolution.
*  2. **Terrestrial Adaptation Evolution in Land Crabs: Exploring at the Genomic Level**
* Sep. 2022 - Present
* **First author**, Master thesis
* 	Performed chromosome-genome assembly using ONT and Hi-C data. 
* 	Extracted RNA from five tissues(Heart, Hepatopancreas, Testis, Muscles, Gills), self-constructed RNA libraries, and full-length cDNA ONT sequencing.
* 	Gene functional annotation.
* 	Analyzed genomic collinearity, evaluated CAZymes families, and identified unique gene families, expansions/contractions, and positive selection to understand its adaptive terrestrial evolution.
*  3. **Uncovering Influenza-Like Virus Clades and New Genera in Invertebrates: Evolutionary Insights into Orthomyxoviridae across Metazoans**
* Jun. 2022 - Jul. 2023
* **Co-first author**, submitted to Current Biology (Cell Press) in collaboration with The Hong Kong Polytechnic University				 
* 	Constructed the phylogenetic tree for the newly recognized viruses alongside known members of Orthomyxoviridae. 
* 	Analyzed the ancestral states of the novel viruses and their host associations.
*  4. [Transcriptome Analysis of Pathogen-Induced Physiological Responses in Shrimp](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/11/2/389)
* Feb. 2022 - Jan. 2023
* **First author**, completed
* 	Gathered nine RNA-Seq project datasets from the NCBI SRA and finally obtained 109 transcriptome expression profiles.
