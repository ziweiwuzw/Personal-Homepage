# Hey there! 👋  

I’m **Ziwei Wu**, a first-year PhD student at the **Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne**. Previously, I completed my master’s degree at the **[School of Ecology](https://eco.sysu.edu.cn/), Sun Yat-Sen University**, focusing on animal genome assembly and evolution, especially in crustaceans. Some of my projects explored how the gut microbiome contributes to dietary evolution in herbivorous crabs. I also investigated virus evolution and host-shifting events in metazoans.  

For my PhD, I’m passionate about understanding how gut microbiome traits might be shaped by or even influence **primate evolution**. My research explores traits primates may have gained or lost over time. For instance, previous studies suggest modern humans might have lost certain immune- or health-related gut microbiome traits due to evolutionary dietary shifts and the modern industrial diet.  

I’m currently conducting research under the guidance of **[Dr. Vanessa Rossetto Marcelino](https://www.hologenomics.org/)**, **Prof. Sammy Bedoui**, and **Dr. Yao-Ban Chan** at Parkville.  

During my master’s journey, I was fortunate to be mentored by **Professor KaYan Ma** from the **[ABEL Lab](https://abel-sysu.github.io/en/)**. Their support and guidance helped shape my scientific curiosity.  

I’m endlessly fascinated by **genome evolution**, **bioinformatics**, **phylogenetic analysis**, and even the magic of **machine learning** 🧬💻. Here's to science, discovery, and endless cups of coffee – let’s make some breakthroughs together! ☕🔍🚀
